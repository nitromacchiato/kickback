#School email verifcation process 
First i would create a table in my database for email verfication process

Then in NextJs I would create static paths based on the id's in the table email verifciation process



So when a user clicks submit to submit their email and other info 
I'll take that information and update the database for the user table but leave the coloum email_verfied null until the user visits the static path to confirm email

 - Need to create a function to verify the values for school and email and make sure theyre not null. if theyre null then pop up an error message
    if theyre not null then route the user to the api to submit the data and continue with the following steps 
- on a successful submission redirect the user to a success page saying they have just been sent an email and to check their inbox 





 
once the user clicks the link in the email it will take them to the static path that was generated 

it'll run a function to confirm their email and update the email_verfied to verfied instead of null in the user table 
then i'll delete the id in the static paths to remove the link
