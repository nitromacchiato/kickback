#School email verifcation process 
First i would create a table in my database for email verfication process 

Then in NextJs I would create static paths based on the id's in the table email verifciation process

So when a user clicks submit to submit their email and other info 

I'll take that information and update the database for the user table but leave the coloum email_verfied null until the user visits the static path to confirm email
 
once the user clicks the link in the email it will take them to the static path that was generated 

it'll run a function to confirm their email and update the email_verfied to verfied instead of null in the user table 
then i'll delete the id in the static paths to remove the link
