## TOP PLAYLIST FOR EACH COAST

#School profiles 
getstatic paths setpaths fallback to true 



# session.playlist 
    - Add a function to only display it if the playlist is not null




#School email verifcation process 
    First i would create a table in my database for email verfication process

    Then in NextJs I would create static paths based on the id's in the table email verifciation process

    So when a user clicks submit to submit their email and other info 
    I'll take that information and update the database for the user table but leave the coloum email_verfied null until the user visits the static path to confirm email

    - Need to create a function to verify the values for school and email and make sure theyre not null. if theyre null then pop up an error message
        if theyre not null then route the user to the api to submit the data and continue with the following steps 
    - on a successful submission redirect the user to a success page saying they have just been sent an email and to check their inbox 

    - Update the user table and upload the school email to the assigned user name and leave school_email_verified blank 
    - Upload a function to the success email component that handles the user infomariton and updates the user table and makes the column email verfied true 

    once the user clicks the link in the email it will take them to the static path that was generated 

    it'll run a function to confirm their email and update the email_verfied to verfied instead of null in the user table 
    then i'll delete the id in the static paths to remove the link
